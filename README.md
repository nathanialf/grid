## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Android Studio** Arctic Fox (2020.3.1) or later
- **Android SDK** API 24 (Android 7.0) minimum
- **JDK** 11 or later

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd grid
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio

3. Sync the project and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

4. Run the application:
   - Connect an Android device or start an emulator
   - Click "Run" in Android Studio or use:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew installDebug
   ```

### Building
```bash
# Debug build
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Release build
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Run tests
./gradlew test

# Run lint checks
./gradlew lint
```

## Configuration

### Network Permissions
The app requires network permissions to connect to remote servers. These are declared in the AndroidManifest.xml:
- `android.permission.INTERNET`
- `android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`

### Biometric Permissions
For biometric authentication (optional):
- `android.permission.USE_BIOMETRIC`
- `android.permission.USE_FINGERPRINT`

## Usage

### Adding a Server Connection
1. Open the Grid application
2. Tap "Add Connection"
3. Select protocol (FTP, SFTP, or SMB)
4. Enter server details:
   - Hostname/IP address
   - Port (optional, uses protocol defaults)
   - Username and password/SSH key
   - Starting directory (optional, for FTP/SFTP only)
5. Test the connection to verify settings
6. Save the connection

**Note**: SMB connection testing works reliably and accurately reflects connection status.

### Managing Credentials
- Credentials are automatically encrypted using Android Keystore
- Enable biometric authentication in settings for additional security
- Credentials are stored locally and never transmitted unencrypted

### File Operations
- Browse remote directories with pull-to-refresh functionality
- Download files to local storage (accessible Downloads folder)
- Upload files from device with real-time progress indicators
- Create, rename, and delete files/folders with confirmation dialogs
- Multi-select mode for batch operations
- Open text, image, PDF, audio, video, and archive files with built-in viewers featuring smooth keyboard scrolling for text editing and pinch-to-zoom and pan gestures
- Extract archive files (ZIP, RAR, 7-Zip, TAR, GZIP) with real-time progress tracking and automatic server upload
- Play animated GIFs with automatic animation and zoom support
- Access Grid files through other apps' file pickers via DocumentsProvider integration
- Sort files by name, type, or modification date

## Development

### Code Style
- Follow Kotlin coding conventions
- Use ktlint for code formatting
- Maintain test coverage for business logic

### Architecture Guidelines
- Keep domain layer pure Kotlin (no Android dependencies)
- Use Repository pattern for data access
- Implement use cases for business logic
- Follow MVVM pattern in presentation layer

### Adding New Protocols
1. Create a new client class implementing `NetworkClient` interface
2. Add protocol enum value in `Protocol.kt`
3. Update `NetworkClientFactory` to handle the new protocol
4. Add corresponding UI elements for protocol-specific settings

## Security Considerations

### Credential Storage
- All credentials are encrypted using Android Keystore
- Encryption keys are hardware-backed when available
- Credentials are automatically wiped on app uninstall

### Network Security
- Connections use protocol-native security (SSH for SFTP, etc.)
- Certificate validation is enforced for secure connections
- No credentials are logged or transmitted in plain text

### Permissions
- Minimal permission model - only required permissions are requested
- Biometric authentication is optional and can be disabled
- Network access is restricted to user-configured servers
